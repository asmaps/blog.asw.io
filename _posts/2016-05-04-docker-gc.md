If you are using docker you will probably encounter sooner or later that you have a lot of old containers and orphaned
images that are not used by any container.

To remove those **start all containers you want to keep** and then run the following:

```
docker ps -q -a |xargs docker rm
docker images -q -a |xargs docker rmi
```

This will produce some errors, but that's good and intended, as it couldn't remove the containers that are running.
